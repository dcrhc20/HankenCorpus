Introduction
The recent rise of social media has helped companies and other causes in building and maintaining online brand communities.  In the world of marketing, social media is “the new black”. The plethora of different social media services and the segmentation of the online crowd has its downsides: choice overload. Surplus is often a desired feature, but when talking about managing your online community, every added service needs looking after. 
There is a library of research on online communities and social media, from analysing online brand community participation (Madupu, 2006), to longitudinal studies of social media usage by the Fortune 500 companies (Barnes, 2010). Most theoretical research focuses on communication and consumer behaviour, while practical research mainly analyses corporate level social media usage. Apart from the horde of, more or less generic, “social media best practice” guides found online, little research has been done on smaller segments. How do small brands, with a very constrained amount of time and money, choose to allocate their social media resources?
For this paper I have chosen to analyse the social media and online brand community management methods implemented by stunt and prank groups. Most stunt and prank groups have evolved from amateur to professional level quite organically, and this can be seen in their online brand management and fan interaction. For these groups, the loyal fan community plays a central part, arguably even more so than in the music industry. This makes stunt and prank groups an excellent segment for an exploratory study.
The rest of this research paper is divided into three sections. The first section discusses online brand communities and social media on a theoretical level. The second section identifies the chosen stunt and prank groups, describes the survey method, and presents the results. The final section summarises and analyses the results, and renders the conclusions.

Stunt and prank groups
WHAT I CONSIDER STUNT AND PRANK GROUPS & WHICH ONES I CHOSE.
Jackass is the most well known American stunt and prank group, originally shown on MTV for three seasons between 2000 and 2002. Although the television series ended in 2002 the brand has stayed active, releasing three feature films since then, of which the last, “Jackass 3D”, was released in late 2010.  (Wikipedia, 2011)
Nitro Circus is an American stunt group doing mainly dirt bike and other motor-based stunts. Their original show was a miniseries Fuel TV in 2006, but they had a two season recurring show on MTV during 2009. According to Wikipedia, a Nitro Circus movie might be released during the summer of 2011. The group also does live shows; the latest live tour was in Australia in 2010.  (Wikipedia, 2011)
Dirty Sanches is a British group doing extreme and dangerous stunts and pranks. Their show was originally show on MTV UK, from 2003 to 2007
