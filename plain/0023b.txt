On Ontological Paradigms ofthe Network Analysis Approach to Sociology of Markets

Abstract
In recent years there has been a growing interest in modelling complex and ambiguous systems of markets. As companies’ strategic decisions are increasingly based on such theoretical models, it is important to understand the fundamental perspectives embedded in them, one such being the ontology


1 Introduction
The salience of economy in the postmodern society in conjunction with the acknowledged social embeddedness of economic action (Granovetter 1985) has brought about the revision of the economic sociology. Since its rebirth the discipline, originating from the works of Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Émile Durkheim (Portes 2010: 10-23), has been dominated by the sociology of markets, ares earch area exploring the structures and the dynamics of markets. Being influenced by the recent advances in the network and system theories, in addition to lacking a shared description of its constitutive perspectives (Portes 2010: 1), this interdisciplinary domain reflects the multiplicity in sciences’ ontological and epistemological stances. 
The sociology of markets has three major analytical approaches: the network analysis, the field analysis, and the performative analysis (Fourcade, 2007: 1017).Of these, the network and the field analysis represent structuralism (1025), portraying markets as social systems, whereas performativity is rather “a theory of modernity” (1026). Compared with the field analysis, having its roots in the social interactionism of Kurt Lewin, or the ontologically distinctive framework of performativity, the network analysis approach is explicitly multidisciplinary. 
Along with the emergent complexity and ambiguity of the business environment, the strategic decisions taken by companies are increasingly relying on the theoretical models of markets. This emphasises the importance of understanding the fundamental assumptions embedded in them (Akerlof 2011, Reyner 2010). Despite the pivotal significance, the ontological perspective has on the interpretation and the application of themodel, few researchers have studied itsvariance inthe area of network analysis.In stead, in the domain of economic sociology, the ontological discussion has been focusing on the pluralist (Latour 2010) relativism (Kjellberg and Helgesson 2006: 841) of performative analysis.…Add Move 2 – Step 3 about the multiple paradigm and business ethics research.
This paper identifies and discusses the ontological perspectives embedded in the network analysis approaches to the sociology of markets. The paper is structured in the following way. First, a literary review of the prevailing network analysis theories is conducted. Second, the ontological analysis framework and method are described. Third, the ontological perspectivesare analysed. Finally, the significance of these perspectives is discussed and future research areas are identified.
