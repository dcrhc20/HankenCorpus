1.	INTRODUCTION
1.1	Establishing A Territory
In recent years, there have been many papers doing research on the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for the company's effects on the phenomenon and influences on social welfare. Also there has been a wide interest of firms and organizations that how they can enhance their brand effects by increasing brand equity in marketplaces.
It is generally accepted that companies nowadays put more effort into strengthen their social awareness when they implement different kinds of marketing activities. On the other hand, naturally, the company's brand building is always strategic and necessary. Therefore, this paper intends to put eyesight on brand equity enhancing, in which is more practical and differentiated if the company's social participations involved.
There are observations by Kapferer (2008, 1) suggesting that customers are more empowered today; organizations have to refine their brands and optimize their brand strategies accordingly. Brand equity has never been more significant than it is today. At the same time, there is now much evidence by Lai (et al, 2010) to support the idea that the effects of corporate social responsibility strengthen the organization's social relationship with the target customers and the organization's reputation so that the brand performance can be completed well.
1.2	Establishing A Niche
However, this view is challenged recently. Since previous studies of Temporal (2010, 4) highlighted that brand image, brand identity and brand awareness can be regarded as a package to build a company's whole brand equity; at the same time, corporate social responsibility usually covers the performances from a brand's image and identity perspective. Therefore, there will be a stronger need to investigate the CSR's influence on brand and brand equity.
As a result, no comprehensive theory appears to exist. Despite the importance of that CSR impacts brand image and brand reputation in customers' mind; few researchers have studied further the internal connection between CSR and brand equity in an organization's perspective.
Therefore, the remaining and unclear situation leads to a question: how does the corporate social responsibility effect an organization's brand equity in a positive way?
1.3	Occupying the Niche
The statements mentioned above actually present a research gap. This paper evaluates the effect on current research both corporate social responsibility and brand equity by studying a famous English football club Manchester United. Many newly information concerning sport and football industry under social context will be provided.
This paper contributes to understand how Manchester United Football Club enriches brand equity in target fans' minds by implementing the differentiated aspects from corporate social activity. Both the qualitative and quantitative research methord are adapted. Qualitative research data adapted in this paper are gathered during an interview of companies, social organizations and fans forums; quantitative research data are collected by delivering questionnaire to big fans database.
This rest of paper is structured into five sections: 1) The definition, properties and features of both CSR and brand equity will be presented as literature reviews. 2) Each segmental item and sub-concept concerning CSR will be explained separately, combining the intentions towards brand equity reinforcement. 3) The methodology used in the study will be discussed. 4) The results of the empirical findings will be illuminated. 5) A summary and conclusion will be established according to a research framework and empirical findings. In addition, a managerial implication for further research will be drawn at last.

2.	LITERRETURE REVIEW
2.1	What Is Brand?
A brand can be defined as a name or term, a sign or symbol, a design, or a mix of all the previous; it intends to recognize goods or services of a seller while distinguishing them from those of others. (American Marketing Association 2011) Kotler (1999, 404) figured out brand as a promise from seller; the promise spreads a set of benefits, characteristics, services to the buyer. Kapferer (2008, 9-10) defined brand from a customer-orientated way. He thought brand has value to create awareness, belief, and bond into receivers' minds and hearts. However, Van Gelder (2003, 1) proposed brand strategically: brand is innovated, stimulated and operated by staffs in organization that induce behavior benefits back to companies. 
In this paper, a brand is an intangible asset held by the service providers; it dumps an organization's business concepts into the customers' brains. To be precise, brand is not only an objective we can look and touch, but also an image we can think and reflect; Furthermore, it creates a relationship of interaction between the customers and the service providers. 
2.2	What Is Brand Equity?
Weng (2006, 147-148) proposed that brand equity is a set of brand assets and liabilities attached to a brand, whose name and symbol subtracted from the value that provided to companies and customers. Views from this paper, brand equity impacts information proceeding, creates greater decision making, thereby meets customers' satisfaction. He continually pointed out that brand equity assists sellers to promote marketing efficiency and effectiveness, establish brand loyalty, improve profit margins, receive leverage over retailers and fulfill diversities over the competition.
Aaker and McLoughlin (2007, 174) presented the sources of brand equity: brand awareness, perceived quality, brand associations, and brand loyalty.
Brand Awareness is the strength of a brand's presence in the mindset of a consumer; it makes customer to buy the product and creates a foundation of relationship that binds the customer and service provider. High brand awareness associates customer strongly and makes him or her purchased the thing more frequently. Sponsorship is an important tool to constitute brand awareness. (Aaker and McLoughlin 2007, 174)
Perceived Quality concentrates on how the quality perceptions affect a customer's purchasing behavior. Its technical and functional aspects make a larger amount of customers to patronize the brand. On the other hand, the customer's pursuit of the perceived quality forms quality advancements backwards the brand provider. (Aaker and McLoughlin 2007, 174)
Brand Associations are made with a brand by consumer. The associations help a consumer to connect with the brand so that the consumer recall or rebuy the brand. The associations can be any aspects relate to brand, such as brand design, brand symbol, and brand term. Marketer creates brand associations, usaully, by using marketing mix elements: product, price, place, and promotion. (Aaker and McLoughlin 2007, 174)
Brand Loyalty is the key consideration when brand provider adds value into a brand; it measures or determines whether a customer is willing to rebuy the brand. A center issue of brand loyalty is that whether the consumer promotes a brand to others by word-of-mouth. In addition, the already-made brand loyalty helps brand provider to get supports from retailers; extensions of good brand is more attractive to retailers. (Aaker and McLoughlin 2007, 174)
2.3	What is CRM?
To define the notion of CSR (which is called fully as corporate social responsibility) is more difficult than ever before. Each organization can describe it from individual business background. Here, Schwartz (2011, 18) brought an idea that corporate social responsibility is an extra obligation of responsibility if companies have only economic and legal obligations; the social responsibility acts as the obligations drives managers to promote and improve the fortune of the society along with their own interests. He continuelly commended that CSR contributes the economic development and improves the quality of life; the community and society at large will get benefits from it.
In Ruschak's (2010, 8) paper, he inserted a definition from The European Commission that corporate social responsibility refers to organization's performances to maintain developments. The main understanding from CSR activities is the reflection of social importance and social consequences that are created from business success. In my own view, CSR brings an idea of “sustainable development” for enterprises that need to consider other social issues out of their business. Moreover, CSR reflects the enterprises responsibility for some societal goods not only in economic or political ways, but also in social way. In the other words, Enterprises should concern about outside groups that affected by themselves.
2.4	Two out of Four Aspects of CSR's Effect
Although we have talked much about what CSR is, how it influences the inside of an organization? Paetzold (2010, 23) here listed 4 aspects of the role and potential of CSR that can influence the organizations' business activities. The four aspects are human resources management, brand differentiation, organizations image enhancement, and revenues improvement. In this paper, two focuses on CSR “Brand Differentiation and CSR” Organizations image are unfolded, because they are practical to consider how CSR increases brand equity of one organization.
Corporate social responsibility can be a source for Brand differentiation. (Esposito 2009, 213) He pointed out that as the customers' social awareness increase; customers are receptive to the social responsibility, which is treated as an approach by companies to produce products and services. At the same time, these customers are willing to pay a higher price for more sustainable products. Therefore, CRS creates explicit functions (social, public-interested, sustainable, or environmental) into one company's products and brand, so that customers feel differently about the influence this brand brought compared with that of others brands provided.
The excellent executed operation of CSR can be seen as an important factor leading an organization to create a positive image in customers' mindset and to be outstanding in the competition. (Ciszewski, 2012) The organization's image can be shifted into the brand image if the branding activity is emphasized all the time by this organization. Organization uses CSR to improve its brand identity and brand awareness in customer's heart, usually and naturally, the brand image is enhanced.
2.5	The Pyramid Model of CSR
Carroll (199, 500) defined the CSR as the "the social responsibility of business encompasses the economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary expectations that society has of organizations at a given point in time". Dusuki (2008) suggested that for a corporate to fully comply with its social obligation, all these four types of expectation must be matched. Carroll named these four elements in a model called the Pyramid of CSR. 
The bottom of the pyramid is economic responsibilities. The economic issue is the initial stage of any business actions made from an organization; it must be managed before the organization being engaged in any social activities, such as charity. The economic responsibility leads to products being sold at fair prices in the society, and creates profits to sustain the organizations' development. (Dusuki 2008)
The dimension in the 3rd layer is legal responsibilities. Even though a firms' business is expected with high profit, it should be sure that business activities must be fulfilled with legal requirements. It is important for a firm to undertake business following government and legislation obligations. (Dusuki 2008)
The next dimension in the 2nd layer is ethical responsibilities, which refers to the organizations' social actions and should be done ethically. The organization should try to avoid any business actions that are forbidden by society (although those are accepted by law). This kind of responsibility is specially related to those social communities who expect their rights are respected. Organizations are required to treat the expectations of ethical norms kindly, meanwhile recognized and respect the new ethical norms adopted by society. (Dusuki 2008)
The last dimension on the top of the pyramid is philanthropic responsibilities. The philanthropic issue drives business to insert philanthropic activities. The philanthropic responsibilities can be in the form of charities, donations, social-related sponsorships, or voluntary contributions, which are highly appreciated by the society because they are naturally voluntary. Organizations are recommended to encourage different communities of people to join in voluntary and charitable activities, so that a community's quality of life can be enhanced. (Dusuki 2008)
3.	METHODOLOGY
3.1	Research Method
Qualitative research is one kind of inquiry appropriate to specific topics. Collecting and gathering deeper understandings of human behavior is the goal of qualitative research. This method mainly explores the â€œwhyâ€? and â€œhowâ€? of decision making, not only what, where, or when. Therefore, the smaller and targeted sample groups are highly welcomed to be picked up, rather than large random sample groups. In the other words, the qualitative research method is an unstructured methodology based on certain targeted groups to investigate insight understanding. (See Denzin K & Lincoln 2005, 1-3)
Quantitative research is a more systematic and scientific investigation approach. Conducting and developing mathematical models and theories or anything involve natural senses. Measurement is the main and central issue of quantitative research. It connects “empirical observation” and “mathematical expression”. Therefore, quantitative research is a structured methodology according to wider sample groups to quantify the date form of statistical analysis. (See Black 1999, 9-10)
In this study, the focus is on the combination of both quantitative research method and the qualitative research method.
